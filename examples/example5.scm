; - This is an example circuit based on a double quantum phase estimator that
; measures + and - at the same time on qubits 0 and 3. In this case, changing 
; the z gate at (1) by an h gate, we obtain either 10 or 00 as results.
;
; Compilation:
;
; - cd to your /examples folder.
;
; - Enter the following:
