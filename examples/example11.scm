;
; - Experiment to produce majoranas.

;
; Compilation (if you have g2q and qre in your system path):
;
; - cd to your /examples folder.
;
; - Enter the following:
;
;   guile example11.scm
;   
; Notice that you will need to have g2q and qre (see README.md for details)
; installed on your system  and your system path variable set to point to both
; in order for this program to work properly. Alternatively, you can:
;
; - copy example11.scm to the main folder of your qre installation.
; 
; - Enter the following:
;
;   guile example11.scm

; to which this one is passed as an argument.
