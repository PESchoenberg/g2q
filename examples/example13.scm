;; Compilation (if you have g2q and qre in your system path):
;; - cd to your /examples folder.
;;
;; - Enter the following:
;;
;;   guile example13.scm
;;   
;; Notice that you will need to have g2q and qre (see README.md for details)
;; installed on your system  and your system path variable set to point to both
;; in order for this program to work properly. Alternatively, you can:
;;
;; - copy example13.scm to the main folder of your qre installation.
;; 
;; - Enter the following:
