;; example17.scm
;;
;; This program shows how to use functions from module g2q3 to easily create
;; QASM2 programs with multiple QPU calls and measurements.
;;
;; Compilation (if you have g2q and qre in your system path):
;;
;; - cd to your /examples folder.
;;
;; - Enter the following:
;;
;;   guile example17.scm
;;   
;; Notice that you will need to have g2q and qre (see README.md for details)
;; installed on your system  and your system path variable set to point to both
;; in order for this program to work properly. Alternatively, you can:
;;
;; - copy example17.scm to the main folder of your qre installation.
;; 
;; - Enter the following:
;;
;;   guile example17.scm

;; qf - Notice that qf is a function that contains the actual code to be compiled

;; to functions such as this one must match the arguments passed to the functions 
;; to which this one is passed as an argument.

;; Arguments:
;; - p_i: counter for qcalls.
;; - p_q: value of q variable.
;; - p_c: c.
;; - p_qnl: p_qn lowest.
;; - p_qnh: p_qn highest.
;; - p_cnl: p_cn lowest.
;; - p_cnh: p_cn highest.
