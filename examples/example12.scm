; - Grover's algorithm.

;
; Compilation (if you have g2q and qre in your system path):
;
; - cd to your /examples folder.
;
; - Enter the following:
;
;   guile example12.scm
;   
; Notice that you will need to have g2q and qre (see README.md for details)
; installed on your system  and your system path variable set to point to both
; in order for this program to work properly. Alternatively, you can:
;
; - copy example12.scm to the main folder of your qre installation.
; 
; - Enter the following:
;
;   guile example12.scm

; qf - Notice that qf is a function that contains the actual code to be compiled
; into QASM2. The function itself is passed as an argument (higher order
; function) to function main-loop. Also take in account that the arguments 
; to functions such as this one must match the arguments passed to the functions 
; to which this one is passed as an argument.

; Arguments:
; - p_i: counter for qcalls.
; - p_q: value of q variable.
; - p_c: c.
; - p_qnl: p_qn lowest.
; - p_qnh: p_qn highest.
; - p_cnl: p_cn lowest.
