;
; example7.scm
;
; - This program is almost the same as example5.scm, but includes a system 
; call that invokes qre. This is a program that allows for execution in real or
; simulated remote quantum computers, or on local simulators, In this regard, 
; g2q and qre act as a JIT compiler/runtime.
;
; Compilation:
;
; - cd to your /examples folder.
;
; - Enter the following:
;
;   guile example7.scm
;
; Notes:
; - This program will only compile a .qasm file but not run it if you don't have
; qre installed on your system.
; - You should make sure that your PATH system variable points to the folder
; where you installed qre.
; - qre is available at https://github.com/PESchoenberg/qre
