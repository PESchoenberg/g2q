; example1.scm
;
; A sample of different gates and functions of g2q. Note that this program does
; not intend to be a functional one. It is just a way to demostrate what gates
; and functions you can write and how. Don't worry about the sense it doesn't 
; make as a practical program.  
;
; Compilation:
;
; - cd to your /examples folder.
;
; - Enter the following:
;
;   guile example1.scm 
;
; Note that quantum processors in practice may or may not have full connectivity
; and thus not all connections between qubits may work. You may need to modify
; qubit numbers or generate new gate sequences to work around  such limitations
; in this and other programs.

; A swap gate. Swap fast gates are better than their non-fast counterparts - in
; this case this means that swap-fast is faster in execution than swap - but 
; might not be recognized by all sorts of QPU, be them simulators or real 
; processors. For such cases, I have written non-fast versions of several gates. 
; These non-fast gates are atomic decompositions of swap-fast gates into gates
; that can be recognized by a wider variety of QPU. So, in principle, if you
; can, use the fast version of a gate when it is available because it will run
; faster and with a lesser error rate, but if you can't or your QPU does not
; recongize the fast gate in question, use the non-fast version.
